# INFO:
# This script is automatically called from ant when publishing MathSAT5.
# There is no need to call this scripts manually, except for developing and debugging.
#
# #########################################

# This script cross-compiles the MathSAT5 library `mathsat5j.dll` on a Linux host for a Windows64 target.
# There are the following dependencies:
# - MinGW (install Ubuntu package: `mingw-w64`)
# - The MathSAT5 library for Windows64 as can be downloaded from http://mathsat.fbk.eu/download.html
# - MathSAT5 is linked against MPIR which aims to be compatible to GMP.
#   Since 2017, MPIR is no longer developed. We use the precompiled `mpir.dll` from the MathSAT5 archive.
#   When compiling our bindings, we use the header files from GMP.
#   We do not actually need to compile it. However, this is a nice test, whether our build system works as expected.
#   To build GMP, download GMP 6.3.0 from http://gmplib.org/ and run
#     ./configure --enable-cxx --with-pic --enable-shared --disable-static --enable-fat --host=x86_64-w64-mingw32
#     make -j4
# - The Windows JNI headers in a reasonable LTS version:
#   Download the zip archive from https://jdk.java.net/ and unpack it
#   (e.g., https://download.java.net/java/GA/jdk17.0.2/dfd4a8d0985749f896bed50d7138ee7f/8/GPL/openjdk-17.0.2_windows-x64_bin.zip).

# To build MathSAT5 bindings: ./compileForWindows-x64.sh $MATHSAT_DIR $GMP_DIR $JNI_DIR
