# #########################################
#
# INFO:
# This script is automatically called from ant when publishing MathSAT5 or OptiMathSAT.
# There is no need to call this scripts manually, except for developing and debugging.
#
# #########################################

# This script builds either libmathsat5j.so (bindings to mathsat5), or
# liboptimathsat5j.so (bindings to optimathsat5).
# In future, mathsat5 and optimathsat should merge, making the switching obsolete.

# For building libmathsat5j.so, there are two dependencies:
# - The static Mathsat5 library as can be downloaded from http://mathsat.fbk.eu/download.html
# - The static GMP library compiled with the "-fPIC" option.
#   To create this, download GMP 6.1.2 from http://gmplib.org/ and run
#     ./configure --enable-cxx --with-pic --disable-shared --enable-fat
#     make

# For building liboptimathsat5.so, OptiMathSat5 can be downloaded from
# http://optimathsat.disi.unitn.it/.

# To build mathsat bindings: ./compile.sh $MATHSAT_DIR $GMP_DIR
# To build optimathsat bindings: ./compile.sh $MATHSAT_DIR $GMP_DIR -optimathsat

# This script searches for all included libraries in the current directory first.
# You can use this to override specific libraries installed on your system.
# You can also use this to force static linking of a specific library,
# if you put only the corresponding .a file in this directory, not the .so file.

# For example, to statically link against libstdc++,
# compile this library with --with-pic,
# and put the resulting libstdc++.a file in this directory.
