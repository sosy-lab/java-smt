/**
 * Floating point operations.
 *
 * <p>Most operations are overloaded: there is an option of either using the default rounding mode
 * (set via the option {@code solver.floatingPointRoundingMode}), or providing the rounding mode
 * explicitly.
 *
 * <p>If the result of an operation can not be exactly represented by the available floating-point
 * type, i.e., the given precision is insufficient, the result is rounded to the nearest possible
 * floating-point representation, depending on the given rounding mode.
 *
 * <p>Example: If the input number is too large to be represented as a floating point with the given
 * type, it will be converted to positive infinity (+inf) or negative infinity (-inf). If the input
 * number is too small to be represented with the given type (closer to zero than the smallest
 * possible floating-point number), it will be converted to zero, with the sign preserved.
