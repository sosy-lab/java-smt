# JavaSMT ChangeLog

## JavaSMT 5.0.0

This major release brings support for the SMT solver Bitwuzla (version 0.4.0), some bugfixes,
and includes several changes in the API.

### New features and breaking changes:
- User propagation can be used to provide a strategy when solving satisfiability (only Z3).
- Array theory supports the creation of constant arrays, e.g., specifying a default value for all indices.
- Bitvector theory provides rotation and improved modulo/remainder operations.
- Floating-point theory has better model evaluation.

### Updated solvers:
- Bitwuzla 0.4.0
- OpenSMT 2.6.0
- Z3 4.12.5

We slowly abandon Ubuntu 18.04 as build platform and will use Ubuntu 22.04 in the future. 

## JavaSMT 4.1.1

This patch release brings small fixes for Z3 and MathSAT.

## JavaSMT 4.1.0

This release brings support for the SMT solver OpenSMT (version 2.5.2).

## JavaSMT 4.0.3

This release contains updates for several dependencies.

## JavaSMT 4.0.2

This patch release improves documentation and updates the dependency for our Yices2 component.
We skip version 4.0.1 which was internally used for releasing the Yices2 component.

## JavaSMT 4.0.0

This major release comes with several updated solvers and dependencies,
a new (potentially faster) evaluator for models,
and support for the theory of enumerations (domains of fixed size).

### Breaking changes:
 - The push-method in ProverEnvironments can throw InterruptedExceptions.
 - Model evaluation supports enumeration theory.
 - Direct construction ArrayFormulaType was replaced with a static building method.

### Updated solvers:
 - MathSAT 5.6.10
 - Z3 4.12.2
 - CVC5 1.0.5

## JavaSMT 3.14.3

This patch release updates SMTInterpol to version 2.5-1242-g5c50fb6d.

We also include the brand-new bindings for the solver CVC5.

## JavaSMT 3.14.1

This patch release brings small bugfixes and improved documentation for formula visitation.

## JavaSMT 3.14.0

This minor release comes a new method 'allChar' in String theory
and brings with a smaller bugfix for formula visitation.

## JavaSMT 3.13.3

This patch release comes with a smaller bugfix for String-theory formulas in Z3.

## JavaSMT 3.13.2

This patch release comes with some updated solvers and some smaller bugfixes.

### Updated solvers:

we improved DIV and MOD operations in Integer theory.

### Updated solvers:
 - MathSAT 5.6.8
 - Princess 2022-07-01
 - Z3 4.8.17

### Breaking change:
The public API for FloatingPointManager was changed to support conversion
of FloatingPoint to signed and unsigned Bitvectors.

## JavaSMT 3.12.0

This release comes with an initial support for String theory for SMT solvers like Z3 and CVC4.
Now, JavaSMT provides statistics on the solving process, depending on the used SMT solver.
And we include several bugfixes and internal cleanup.

### Breaking change:
The public API was enriched with new methods to retrieve a StringFormulaManager and statistics.

## JavaSMT 3.11.0

This release comes with support for multiple prover stacks in SMTInterpol.

### Breaking change:
Users might have accessed the public class `SmtInterpolEnvironment` for direct interaction with SMTInterpol.
We replace the class `org.sosy_lab.java_smt.solvers.smtinterpol.SmtInterpolEnvironment`
with the class `de.uni_freiburg.informatik.ultimate.logic.Script`,
which provides a similar interface and also allows direct interaction with SMTInterpol.

   Z3 Java bindings.
 - Adds `getModelAssignments` method to `ProverEnvironment`, which serializes
   the model to a list of assignments.
 - Switches to manual closing (try-with-resources) for `Model` objects.

    Assumptions feature is emulated in solvers which do not support it natively.

    `GENERATE_UNSAT_CORE`, `GENERATE_UNSAT_CORE_OVER_ASSUMPTIONS`.
 - Adds support for floating point theory in Z3.
 - Adds recursive transformation visitor for boolean formulas, which does not
    use recursion in its implementation
    (via `BooleanFormulaManager#transformRecursively`).
 - Many miscellaneous bugfixes.
