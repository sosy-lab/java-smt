JavaSMT is a common API layer for accessing various SMT solvers.
The API is optimized for performance (using JavaSMT has very little runtime
overhead compared to using the solver API directly), customizability
(features and settings exposed by various solvers should be visible through the
wrapping layer) and type-safety (it shouldn't be possible to add boolean terms
to integer ones at _compile_ time) sometimes at the cost of verbosity.

### Feature overview

JavaSMT can express formulas in the following theories:

 - Integer
 - Rational
 - Bitvector
 - Floating Point
 - Array
 - Uninterpreted Function
 - String and RegEx

The concrete support for a certain theory depends on the underlying SMT solver.
Only a few SMT solvers provide support for theories like Arrays, Floating Point, String or RegEx.

#### Solver support for different Operating System and Architectures

JavaSMT supports several SMT solvers (see [Getting Started](doc/Getting-started.md) for installation):

We support a reasonable list of operating systems and versions.
- Our main target is Linux (mainly Ubuntu or comparable Linux distributions).
  Windows 10/11 and MacOS are supported for several SMT solvers.
- Our main development architecture is x64 (x86-64).
  We also provide some solvers for ARM64 (AArch64 for ARMv8-A), e.g., Java-based SMT solvers, Z3, and MathSAT.
  If a specific operating system or architecture is missing and required,
  please do not hesitate and open an issue!

On all operating systems and architectures, JavaSMT requires Java 11 or newer.
Unless otherwise noted, the solver requires a minimum of `GLIBC_2.28` on Linux,
available with Ubuntu 18.04 or later.  

² Solver requires at least `GLIBC_2.29`/`GLIBCXX_3.4.26` or `GLIBC_2.34`/`GLIBCXX_3.4.29`,
available with Ubuntu 22.04 or later.  
³ We do not provide a signed solver library for MacOS. The user needs to compile and sign it.

#### Solver Features

The following features are supported (depending on the used SMT solver):

 - Satisfiability checking
 - Quantifiers and quantifier elimination
 - Incremental solving with assumptions
 - Incremental solving with push/pop
 - Multiple independent contexts
 - Model generation
 - Interpolation, including tree and sequential structure
 - Formula transformation using built-in tactics
 - Formula introspection using visitors

We aim for supporting more important features, more SMT solvers, and more systems.
If something specific is missing, please [look for or file an issue](https://github.com/sosy-lab/java-smt/issues).

Interruption using a [ShutdownNotifier][] may be used to interrupt a solver from any thread.
Formulas are translatable in between contexts/provers/threads using _FormulaManager.translateFrom()_.

⁴ Multiple contexts, but all operations on each context only from a single thread.  
⁵ Multiple provers on one or more contexts, with each prover using its own thread.

#### Garbage Collection in Native Solvers

JavaSMT exposes an API for performing garbage collection on solvers implemented in a native language.
As a native solver has no way of knowing whether the created formula object is still referenced 
by the client application, this API is necessary to avoid leaking memory.
Note that several solvers already support _hash consing_ and thus,
there is never more than one copy of an identical formula object in memory.
Consequently, if all created formulas are later re-used (or re-created)
in the application, it is not necessary to perform any garbage collection at all.
Additionally, the memory for formulas created on user-side (i.e., via JavaSMT) is negligible
compared to solver-internal memory-consumption when solving a hard SMT query.

- **Z3**: The parameter `solver.z3.usePhantomReferences` may be used to control 
  whether JavaSMT will attempt to decrease references on Z3 formula 
  objects once they are no longer referenced.
- **MathSAT5**: Currently we do not support performing garbage collection for MathSAT5.
- **CVC4, CVC5, Bitwuzla, OpenSMT**: Solvers using SWIG bindings do perform garbage collection.
- **Other native SMT solvers**: we do not perform garbage collection.

## Getting started

Installation is possible via [Maven][Maven repository],
[Ivy][Ivy repository], or [manually][Manual Installation].
Please see our [Getting Started Guide](doc/Getting-started.md).

#### Usage

``` java
// Instantiate JavaSMT with SMTInterpol as backend (for dependencies cf. documentation)
try (SolverContext context = SolverContextFactory.createSolverContext(
        config, logger, shutdownNotifier, Solvers.SMTINTERPOL)) {
  IntegerFormulaManager imgr = context.getFormulaManager().getIntegerFormulaManager();

  // Create formula "a = b" with two integer variables
  IntegerFormula a = imgr.makeVariable("a");
  IntegerFormula b = imgr.makeVariable("b");
  BooleanFormula f = imgr.equal(a, b);

  // Solve formula, get model, and print variable assignment
  try (ProverEnvironment prover = context.newProverEnvironment(ProverOptions.GENERATE_MODELS)) {
    prover.addConstraint(f);
    boolean isUnsat = prover.isUnsat();
    assert !isUnsat;
    try (Model model = prover.getModel()) {
      System.out.printf("SAT with a = %s, b = %s", model.evaluate(a), model.evaluate(b));
    }
  }
}
```
